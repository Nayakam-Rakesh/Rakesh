Project Title:
This React web application has three main features:

Counter Component:
Buttons for increment, decrement, and reset the counter.
The background color changes smoothly based on the counter value.
State should persist across page reloads (using localStorage or React State).

User Data Form:

Form for name, address, email, and phone.
Automatically generates a user ID and saves the data.
Warns if the user tries to leave the form with unsaved changes.

Rich Text Editor:

Display and format user data with options like bold, italic, underline, and lists.
Data is saved and persists across page reloads.

Libraries Used:

React for UI.
TypeScript for type safety and early error detection.
Material UI / Chakra UI for UI components.
React Spring for smooth animations.
React Router for navigation.
Redux Toolkit (RTK) for state management and persistence.

Project Flow:

User interacts with the Counter, Form, or Editor.
State is managed by React or RTK and stored in localStorage.
Data is persisted and remains available after page reloads.
